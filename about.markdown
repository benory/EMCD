We're often told how musicology departments in Europe played important roles in the revival of medieval and Renaissance music performance following World War I. 

Descriptions of seminars led by scholars such as Friedrich Ludwig in Göttingen, or Heinrich Besseler in Heidelberg often focus on music-making through which students and professors alike acquainted themselves with unfamiliar repertoires. As Besseler's student Hans Eppstein noted decades later, "there was not an hour when students and assistants were not singing and playing."[^1]

But this project argues that performance in more formal contexts was also essential in the rediscovery of early music. And a whole additional category of evidence for this survives in abundance, but has until now largely been ignored: programs for public concerts between 1915 and 1960—often introduced, directed, performed, or heard by these very same scholars—that included music from before 1600. To better understand the emergence of the early music performance tradition on both sides of the Atlantic, we need to systematically collect and curate all this information in a way that moves beyond narrative descriptions of a few individual concerts.

This project aims to meet this challenge by creating a relational database and mapping tool that will allow users to selectively display patterns of carefully-curated data from these programs. Users will be able to query the database to ask questions about the popularization of repertoires; the use of new performance and scholarly editions; the figures involved in the concerts; the early music objects that scholars and performers referenced and transcribed from; and the establishment of local, national, and international early music canons. 

Collecting this information is not simple: these programs are rarely published or digitized, but are instead often only found buried in personnel and institute files in university archives. This project seeks to collate and map materials, and provide context for important concerts. It also aims to enable users to flexibly manipulate this data to answer their own research questions.
